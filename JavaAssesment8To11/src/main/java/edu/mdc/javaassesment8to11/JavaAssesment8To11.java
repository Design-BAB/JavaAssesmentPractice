        Write code to open and read a file. The file will have two integers on each line for unknown number 
        of lines. The program should read each line as string and parse the string into two integers. The value 
        of the two integers should be printed with a message: “Line number” followed by the line where the 
        data was read from. And on the same line, “Integer 1 =” followed by the value on first integer and 
        “Integer 2 =” followed by value of the second integer.  If the file has incorrectly formatted data, the 
        program should print an error message and terminate. 
        
        Using the program from number 9 above, instead of printing the two values, store them in two 
        separate arrays of size 100. First array will hold the first integer values and the second array will hold 
        the second integer values. Then after the whole file is processed, use a loop to traverse the array and 
        print the values same as in number 8: “Line number” followed by the line where the data was read 
        from. And on the same line, “Integer 1 =” followed by the value on first integer and “Integer 2 =” 
        followed by value of the second integer. For the purpose of this code assume that the file can never 
        have more than 100 elements.
