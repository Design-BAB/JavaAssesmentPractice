# Java Programming Practice: CIS101 & CIS201

This repository contains a series of Java exercises and assessments inspired by coursework from **CIS101 (Intro to Programming)** and **CIS201 (Object-Oriented Programming)**. The goal is to reinforce foundational programming concepts while building clean, testable, and readable code.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- File I/O (reading structured data from text files)
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Exception handling (`try/catch`, custom error messages)
- Object-oriented design (classes, constructors, getters)
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Method creation and parameter handling

- ## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- **Dynamic object creation**: Reads pairs of integers from a file and stores them as `Person` objects in an `ArrayList`.
- **Error handling**: Detects malformed lines and invalid data (e.g. negative integers), and responds with clear messages.
- **Validation logic**: Skips invalid entries and reports how many valid objects were stored.
- **Custom method**: Includes a method that throws an exception if passed an empty string, demonstrating basic input validation.
